A package implementing a particle filter and the SMC^2 algorithm to estimate states and parameters of the stochastic volatility (SV) model. 

Particle (bootstrap) filter implemented in Rcpp and used for the SMC^2 algorithm which is implemented for both one parameter (mu) in the SV model and then modified to extend its functionality to also simultaneously estimate sigma. 

SMC.Rmd contains some extracts of code used for this as well as a brief description and some figures of results.
