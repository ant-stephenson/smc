This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(smc)

set.seed(1)

# # not the same for whatever reason, so use test version
# test_Xt <- test_generate_SV_data(mu, rho, sigma2, tt)
# Xt <- generate_SV_data(mu, rho, sigma2, tt)
# Yt <- rnorm(tt, 0, 1) * exp(Xt)
# 
# print(test_Xt)
# print(Xt)

tt = 100
mu = 1
rho = 0.95
sigma2 = 1

Xt <- generate_SV_data(mu, rho, sigma2, tt)
Yt <- as.matrix(rnorm(tt+1, 0, 1) * exp(Xt))
boot_sv <- Bootstrap_SV$new(data=Yt, mu=-1, sigma=0.15, rho=0.9)

N <- 10
output <- bootstrap_filter(boot_sv, N, tt)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
